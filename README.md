[*SparkFun RS232 Breakout (PRT-08780)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8780)

This board has one purpose in life - to convert RS232 to TTL and vice versa (TX and RX). This will allow a microcontroller to communicate with a computer. 
Shifter SMD is powered from the target application and can run at any voltage! 
This version comes with no DB9 connector attached. 
Useful for field installations and projects where RS232 serial is coming from something other than a DB9 cable.
